# Branch Basics

## What is a branch?
A separate line of development - like a copy where you can experiment safely.

## Key commands
- `git branch` - list branches (press 'q' to exit!)
- `git checkout -b <name>` - create and switch to new branch
- `git checkout <name>` - switch to existing branch
- `git merge <branch>` - merge a branch into current branch

## Why use branches?
- Experiment without breaking main code
- Work on features independently
- Easy to undo - just delete the branch

- you can delete a branch with `git branch -d <name>` when done.
